# moodle_query
This script automatically queries if Moodle class / grade pages changed after the last execution. The script is for Bogazici University Moodle accounts, but it can be modified for other universities.

It's just a one-file script, `query.py`. It needs Python. After that's satisfied, "requirements" should be satisfied, which can be done with running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The credentials should be entered in the file `credentials.json`.

Requirements: `bs4, requests`
