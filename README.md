# moodle_query
This script automatically queries if Moodle class / grade pages changed after the last execution.

It's just a one-file script, "query.py". It needs Python. After that's satisfied, "requirements" should be satisfied, which can be done with running the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

Requirements:
bs4, requests
